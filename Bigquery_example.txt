UNSET :It basically lets you take elements in an array and expand each one of these individual elements. You can then join your original row against each unnested element to add them to your table. To use a simpler example, let's imagine we have a table full of spaceships
SELECT key FROM UNNEST(['key1', 'key1','key2','key3']) key
