########################################Understand the Data Analytics Lifecycle on Google Cloud############################
00:00
Before learning about the analysis stage, it’s important to understand the various storage solutions Google Cloud offers.
00:06
Every application needs to store data, and different applications and workloads require different storage solutions.
00:12
This section focuses on the storage step of the data analytics lifecycle.
00:18
Google Cloud offers several core storage products.
00:20
This list includes: Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, BigQuery, Firestore, Cloud Bigtable, and AlloyDB for PostgreSQL.
00:34
Depending on your use case, you might use one or several of these services to do the job.
00:39
Before getting into the details of each of these storage options, let’s differentiate between data sources.
00:45
Data sources are connectors that let you query data from various sources.
00:50
You can use data sources to create datasets, which are collections of data that can be used for analysis and machine learning.
00:57
Google Cloud data sources can be classified into two categories: Cloud data sources are data sources that are stored on Google Cloud.
01:06
For example, you can connect to a Cloud Storage bucket or a Cloud SQL database.
01:11
External data sources can be stored on-premises or in another cloud provider.
01:15
For example, you can connect to an Amazon S3 bucket or a Microsoft SQL Server database.
01:22
You can create a data source connection by using the Google Cloud console, the Cloud SDK, or the Google Cloud API.
01:30
What are some benefits of using Google Cloud data sources?
01:34
First, Google Cloud data sources give centralized access to your data, which makes it easier to find and analyze data, regardless of where it’s stored.
01:44
Google Cloud data sources also help you integrate data from different sources.
01:48
This integration can be helpful for building data warehouses and data lakes.
01:53
We discuss these storage options in this course.
01:56
They can also be used to analyze your data, so you can identify trends, make predictions, and make better business decisions.
02:03
Finally, in general, data sources can be used to visualize your data, to help you communicate your findings to others and make your data more actionable.
02:12
Now that you know what data sources are and the benefits of using Google Cloud data sources, let’s explore storage options.
02:19
The list of storage options includes databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.
02:24
A database is an organized collection of data stored in tables and accessed electronically from a computer system.
02:31
and accessed electronically from a computer system.
02:32
Google Cloud offers relational and non-relational database options.
02:37
Relational databases, such as Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, and AlloyDB for PostgreSQL store and provide access to data points that are related to one another.
02:47
A relational database can establish links–or relationships–between information by joining tables, and structured query language, or SQL, can be used to query and manipulate data.
02:58
This type of database is highly consistent, reliable, and best suited for dealing with large amounts of structured data.
03:06
A non-relational database, sometimes known as a NoSQL database, is less structured in format and doesn’t use a tabular format of rows and columns like relational databases.
03:20
Non-relational databases follow a flexible data model, which makes them ideal for storing data that changes its organization frequently or for applications that handle diverse types of data.
03:30
Bigtable is a non-relational database product.
03:33
While a database is designed to capture data for storage, retrieval, and use, a data warehouse is designed to analyze data.
03:42
A data warehouse is an enterprise system used for the analysis and reporting of structured and semi-structured data from multiple sources.
03:51
BigQuery is Google Cloud's data warehouse offering.
03:55
This course focuses on analyzing data in BigQuery and visualizing it with Looker and Looker Studio.
04:01
A data lake is a repository designed to ingest, store, explore, process, and analyze any type or volume of raw data, regardless of the source.
04:11
It can store different types of data in its original format; ignoring size limits, and without much pre-processing or adding structure.
04:19
Data lakes often consist of many different products, depending on the nature of the data that is ingested.
04:25
Data warehouses and data lakes should be considered complementary instead of competing tools.
04:30
Although both store data in some capacity, each is optimized for different uses.
04:36
Different data types have different purposes and uses.
04:40
Structured data, which is data that has been organized into rows and columns, is best fit for data analytics.
04:46
This type of data is well-suited for statistical analysis and other techniques used in data analytics.
04:52
Machine learning can use both structured and unstructured data.
04:57
Unstructured data is data that does not fit neatly into a table or spreadsheet.
05:01
This type of data can be text, images, or audio.
05:05
Machine learning algorithms can learn from unstructured data to identify patterns and make predictions.




#######################################################Explore Data and Extract Insights by Using BigQuery

00:00
Hello and welcome to this module on exploring data and extracting insights using BigQuery.
00:06
BigQuery is at the very core of analytics on Google Cloud.
00:10
BigQuery is a fully-managed data warehouse.
00:13
A data warehouse is a large store, containing terabytes and petabytes of data gathered from a wide range of sources within an organization, that's used to guide management decisions.
00:23
There are three sections in this module.
00:25
First, you learn all about BigQuery, Google Cloud’s data warehouse solution.
00:29
Next, you learn how BigQuery works, and how to derive insights from your data.
00:34
Finally, you learn how BigQuery organizes data to make analytics easier for data analysts.
00:39
Along the way, you will view demo content of the BigQuery user interface.
00:43
Ready?
00:44
Let’s get started!


#############################################################Explore Data and Extract Insights by Using BigQuery


Let’s begin with an introduction to BigQuery for data analysts.
00:04
In this section, we introduce BigQuery, Google’s data warehouse solution, and discuss its features and uses, and conclude with a demo.
00:13
What do we mean when we say BigQuery is a fully managed data warehouse?
00:18
It means that BigQuery takes care of the underlying infrastructure, so you can focus on using SQL queries to answer business questions without worrying about deployment, scalability, and security.
00:30
At this point, it’s useful to consider what the main difference is between a data warehouse and a data lake.
00:37
A data lake is just a pool of raw, unorganized, and unclassified data, which has no specified purpose.
00:43
On the other hand, a data warehouse contains structured and organized data, which can be used for advanced querying.
00:51
As a data warehouse, BigQuery can store transformed data for business insights.
00:58
Data sources feed into a data lake and are processed into your data warehouse for analysis and reporting.
01:06
Of course, the purpose of BigQuery is not to just save data; it’s for analyzing data and helping to make business decisions.
01:14
BigQuery is optimized for running analytic queries over large datasets.
01:18
It can perform queries on terabytes of data in seconds and petabytes in minutes.
01:24
This performance lets you analyze large datasets efficiently and get insights in near real time.
01:33
To give you an idea of the scale of data BigQuery can work with: One Google Cloud customer has over 350 PB of data stored in BigQuery.
01:44
Other customers have run queries on over 10 trillion rows and concurrent queries running on over 100 trillion rows over multiple customers.
01:54
And another customer has run 10,000 concurrent queries at the same time.
02:01
So what does a typical data warehouse solution architecture look like?
02:06
BigQuery is the analytics engine that sits at the end of the data pipeline.
02:10
It stores incoming data and then lets you do your analysis and model building.
02:16
BigQuery is actually two services in one: it’s both a fast SQL query engine and also a fully managed storage layer for loading and storing your datasets.
02:27
BigQuery maximizes flexibility by separating the compute resources that analyze your data from your storage choices.
02:35
You can store and analyze your data within BigQuery or use BigQuery to assess your data where it lives.
02:41
Federated queries let you read data from external sources while streaming supports continuous data updates.
02:48
Powerful tools like BigQuery ML and BI Engine let you analyze and understand that data.
02:53
Let’s look at some of the key features of BigQuery.
02:58
First, BigQuery provides two services in one.
03:01
It’s a place to store and analyze petabytes of data, with built-in features like machine learning, geospatial analysis, and business intelligence.
03:10
BigQuery is a fully managed serverless solution, which means that you don’t need to worry about provisioning any resources or
03:15
managing servers in the backend but only focus on using SQL queries to answer your organization's questions in the frontend.
03:24
If you’ve never written SQL before, don’t worry.
03:27
This course provides resources and labs to help.
03:31
BigQuery has a flexible on-demand pricing model where you pay for the number of bytes of data your query processes and for any permanent table storage.
03:39
If you prefer to have a fixed bill every month, you can also subscribe to capacity compute pricing where you have a reserved amount of resources for use.
03:49
Data in BigQuery is encrypted at rest by default without any action required from a customer.
03:55
By encryption at rest, we mean encryption used to protect data that is stored on a disk, including solid-state drives, or backup media.
04:04
And finally, BigQuery has built-in machine learning features so you can write ML models directly in BigQuery using SQL.
04:11
Also, if you decide to use other professional tools—such as Vertex AI from Google Cloud—to train your ML
04:17
models, you can export datasets from BigQuery directly into Vertex AI for a seamless integration across the data-to-AI lifecycle.
04:27
Now it’s time to login to the BigQuery user interface, to demonstrate how you can query Terabytes of data in seconds.
04:36
First things first, let's open BigQuery, which can be found in the navigation menu.
04:42
Now this is what the BigQuery user interface looks like.
04:45
Every resource in Google Cloud exists inside a project, which you can view here.
04:51
In addition to security and access control, a project is what links usage of a resource to a credit card: it makes a resource billable.
04:59
BigQuery has numerous public datasets that anyone can query.
05:03
One of these is all public Wikipedia page metadata.
05:06
Next, let’s simply paste and run a SQL query to see how fast BigQuery can
05:11
scan and process 10 billion rows looking for the word “Google” in the Wikipedia page title.
05:18
BigQuery's scalable, distributed analysis engine lets you query terabytes in seconds and petabytes in minutes.
05:26
The query includes filtering, grouping, and ordering on a dataset that contains 10 billion records and runs quickly and efficiently in BigQuery.
05:36
In BigQuery, data is stored inside datasets.
05:39
Datasets contain tables, and tables contain columns.
05:42
Access to data in BigQuery is controlled at many levels, from the project and dataset to the individual table, column, and row.
05:50
A BigQuery slot is a virtual CPU used by BigQuery to execute SQL queries.
05:56
BigQuery automatically calculates how many slots each query requires, depending on query size and complexity.
06:03
You don't need to provision resources before using BigQuery, unlike many relational database management systems.
06:10
BigQuery allocates storage and query resources dynamically based on your usage patterns.
06:16
Storage resources are allocated as you consume them and deallocated as you remove data or drop tables.
06:23
Query resources are allocated according to query type and complexity.
06:28
Each query uses some number of slots, which are units of computation that comprise a certain amount of CPU and RAM.
06:36
There is no minimum usage commitment.
06:38
The service allocates and charges for resources based on your actual usage.
06:44
By default, all BigQuery customers have access to 2,000 slots for query operations.
06:50
You can also reserve a fixed number of slots for your project


######################################################Explore Data and Extract Insights by Using BigQuery


This section is a bit more technical and explores how BigQuery works.
00:04
Let’s begin by discussing how BigQuery’s two services, analytics and storage, work together to power your data-driven innovation.
00:14
Google's high speed internal network connects the two services.
00:17
This super fast network is what enables us to separate compute and storage.
00:21
So what does each service do?
00:24
The short answer is that the services are fully-managed so users like you and me don’t
00:28
have to worry about how BigQuery stores data on disk or autoscales machines for big queries.
00:35
That said, it’s a great learning exercise to understand how the services perform their magic so we can better understand what is happening.
00:44
First up is the BigQuery storage service.
00:46
The storage service automatically manages the data that you ingest into the platform.
00:52
BigQuery organizes data tables into units called datasets.
00:55
These datasets are scoped to your Google Cloud project.
00:58
When you reference a table from the command line in SQL queries or in code, you refer to it by using the construct: project.dataset.table.
01:09
The tables are stored as highly compressed columns in Google’s Colossus file system which provides durability and availability.
01:18
The storage service supports bulk data ingest and streaming ingest.
01:22
So it can work with huge amounts of data and also real-time data streams.
01:28
The query service runs interactive or batch queries that are submitted through console, the BigQuery web UI, the bq command line tool, or REST API.
01:38
The REST API is supported for seven programming languages.
01:43
Recall, in the demo earlier, we used the BigQuery web UI to submit the query.
01:50
There are connectors to other services such as Dataproc, which simplify creating complex workflows between BigQuery and other Google Cloud data processing services.
02:02
The query service can also run query jobs on data contained in other locations, such as tables in CSV files hosted in Cloud Storage or data in Google Sheets.
02:12
Before you get too excited about running queries on your data in Google Sheets, you should
02:17
know that BigQuery is most efficient when working with data contained in its own storage service.
02:22
The storage service and the query service work together to internally organize the data and make queries efficient over huge datasets of Petabytes in size.
02:32
They even optimize your query processing job after you submit it.
02:38
One of the most important controls you have over resource consumption and costs is controlling the amount of data processed.
02:45
In general, you only want to select the columns of data you actually want to process and return.
02:52
A best practice is to start broad when you’re exploring the dataset and then focus on those critical fields and rows that you need.
03:00
Exploring your dataset with SQL is your first step in uncovering hidden insights.
03:05
Let’s briefly go back to the BigQuery user interface and view another example.
03:11
Here we’re running a query to count the total number of trips taken on the public dataset for San Francisco bike share trips.
03:20
There is often uncertainty around the quality of the data in your dataset, so you can use SQL to explore and filter for anomalies.
03:28
Here we filtered customer records that didn’t contain a birth date by setting member_birth_year IS NOT NULL as a filter.
03:35
We also applied the group by clause to group the results by the starting station name.
03:40
The order by clause helps with sorting the results, while the limit only shows the top 5 results.






################################################################Explore Data and Extract Insights by Using BigQuery

In addition to fast query execution times, recall that BigQuery also manages the storage and metadata for your datasets.
00:06
Let’s discuss how BigQuery organizes data to make exploration and analytics easier.
00:14
What are some reasons to structure your information into datasets, projects, and tables?
00:19
These multiple scopes—project, dataset, and table—can help you structure your information logically.
00:25
You can use multiple datasets to separate tables pertaining to different analytical domains, and you can use project-level scoping to isolate datasets from each other according to your business needs.
00:36
You can align projects to billing and use datasets for access control.
00:41
You store data in separate tables based on logical schema considerations.
00:47
Every table has a schema.
00:48
You can enter the schema manually through the Google Cloud console or by supplying a JSON file.
00:54
File formats like Avro, Parquet, ORC, Firestore export, or Datastore export are self-describing, so BigQuery automatically infers the table schema from the source data.
01:08
BigQuery is called a "columnar store," which means that it is designed for processing columns, not rows.
01:14
Because BigQuery only reads the relevant columns to execute a query, it is optimized for the high reads of data warehouses.
01:21
Since each column has data of the same type, BigQuery can compress the column data much more effectively.
01:28
Each column is automatically compressed, encrypted, and replicated to support availability and durability of data in BigQuery.
01:37
BigQuery stores data in a massively distributed format.
01:40
This is the same for Google Cloud Storage and is what powers apps like Gmail, Ads, and many more Google products.
01:48
BigQuery auto-optimizes the balancing and partitioning of these data shards in the back end.
01:53
Alternatively, you can also partition and cluster your tables based on your access patterns to control costs and make your queries more performant.
02:00
Let’s once again demonstrate how to use SQL in BigQuery to analyze data.
02:07
Following this demo, you’ll get hands-on experience with a lab.
02:11
The first thing we’ll do is add some data.
02:12
Let’s click Add Data and then select Public Datasets.
02:16
And in this case we want to analyze New York Citi bike trip data, so let’s search for that data set and then click View Dataset.
02:28
In the BigQuery console, you see two projects in the left pane, one named your Qwiklabs project ID, and one named bigquery-public-data.
02:39
Let’s scroll down and find our table.
02:49
And then we’ll select the table and then the Preview tab to examine the columns and data.
02:59
Next, let’s run a new query.
03:09
This query will tell us the typical duration for the 10 most common one-way rentals.
03:17
Let’s run one more query, this time to find the total distance traveled by each bicycle in the dataset.
03:28
Note that in this case we are pulling data from a couple different datatables (citybike_trips and citibike_stations) and joining the tables together to get the intended results.

####################################################Make Data-driven Decisions by Using Looker

Welcome to this section on Looker, where you learn the fundamentals of analyzing, visualizing, and sharing data by using the Looker platform.
00:07
With Looker, you can activate and use the data you’ve analyzed to empower your teams to make effective, data-driven decisions.
00:14
So, what’s Looker?
00:16
Looker is a powerful tool that helps you: Access and review the data that your company collects.
00:21
Answer data questions in real-time.
00:23
Stay up-to-date with the status of your business.
00:26
And use data to drive decision making.
00:28
Let’s examine the common data analysis process in Looker.
00:32
First, identify the data questions you want to answer.
00:36
Perhaps you’re an analyst for an ecommerce retailer.
00:39
Some standard questions include: How many sales were made last week?
00:42
What’s your user or customer demographics?
00:45
What is the shipment status of all orders?
00:48
The next step is to identify the data required to answer your questions.
00:53
Referring to our previous ecommerce example, if you want to determine the shipment status of all
00:57
orders, you need data on orders, shipments, and perhaps additional info such as distribution center data.
01:05
If you’re analyzing your users, you might want data on where those users are coming from, such as traffic source and location.
01:11
Next, it’s time to analyze the data.
01:15
In Looker, data analysis is referred to as “exploring.”
01:18
After you identify your data questions and the data that you need, you're ready to combine dimensions and measures in Looker to find the answers.
01:26
You learn more about dimensions and measures in this course.
01:29
Finally, interpret the results.
01:32
After you analyze and visualize the data, you can gain insight, act, and make data-driven decisions.
01:39
Referring to the ecommerce example, perhaps you discovered that a large percentage of your customers were directed to your website from a recent campaign designed by your marketing team.
01:49
By using data to show the success of the campaign, you can advocate for more similar campaigns in the future to increase sales.
01:57
In this section you learn to: Manipulate a Looker Explore to answer data-driven questions.
02:01
Create a situation-appropriate visualization to highlight the answer for a data-driven question.
02:07
And share visualizations with others.
02:08
Let’s get started!


##################################################################Make Data-driven Decisions by Using Looker


Let’s begin by viewing the Looker interface, and detailing the main components used for data exploration.
00:06
In Looker, an Explore is a report-builder interface, and a portal to ask questions by using your data.
00:13
Explores are curated by Looker developers in a proprietary templating language called LookML.
00:19
The Explores that you were given access to are listed in the Explore section.
00:23
This Explore example contains ecommerce data.
00:26
The left side panel displays the field picker, where fields are bundled into groups called views.
00:32
The two primary fields for exploring data in Looker are dimensions and measures.
00:37
Dimensions are attributes or characteristics of your data.
00:41
Each column in a database table is a dimension in Looker.
00:44
For example, this database table displays data for orders.
00:48
Each column in the table displays an attribute for the order, such as the date the order was placed, the sale price, and the shipping status.
00:57
In Looker, all of these columns are dimensions.
01:01
Measures are calculations performed across multiple rows of data.
01:05
As such, measures are aggregates of data attributes, or dimensions.
01:09
Perhaps you want to learn how many orders were placed last week.
01:13
Anytime you have a question like “how many,” you probably want to look for a measure with the word count or number in it (in this case, count).
01:21
To find the answer to this data question, you must first group the data by dimension–in this case, the order date–and then add a count measure.
01:30
You often need to combine dimensions and measures to answer your data questions.
01:35
These dimensions and measures can also span across multiple views.
01:39
Let’s look at another example, this time analyzing user data.
01:43
Notice that the dimensions in the field picker are listed alphabetically, and some dimensions are grouped, like Created Date.
01:50
Use the search function to quickly find the dimension you’re looking for.
01:54
In this example, the goal is to identify which cities have the most users, so start by
01:58
adding the city dimension and then the count measure to see how many users are in each city.
02:06
Set a row limit to 10 to see the top 10 cities.
02:09
After all is set, click Run to display the top 10 cities based on the number of users.
02:15
Let’s go a step further and adjust the visualization.
02:18
There are various different visualization options to choose from.
02:21
In this example, it probably makes sense to display the visualization as a column chart.
02:26
You can also add labels to the side of each bar to see the total bar value.
02:30
Click Edit, and turn on Value Labels in the Values tab.
02:34
Each column in the chart now has its value displayed.
02:37
Now, the column chart showing the top 10 cities with the most users is complete.
02:43
Next, let’s filter the results.
02:46
Filters narrow the results returned based on specific criteria, so you can focus on a subset of your data based on desired characteristics.
02:54
A key feature of filters is that they don’t delete anything from the database; they’re only applied to the data that Looker displays on your screen.
03:02
You can filter both dimensions and measures.
03:05
The following example demonstrates how to filter on a dimension.
03:09
Perhaps the results of our previous query–displaying cities across the United States–is too broad, and
03:14
instead you want to narrow the results to only show cities in the state of California.
03:19
You can narrow the results by adding a filter for the state of California.
03:23
After you rerun the query, The results are filtered to display just the top 10 cities in California.
03:31
The final exploring technique covered in this section is pivoting.
03:35
Pivots let you turn a selected dimension into several columns, which creates a matrix of your data.
03:41
Perhaps in addition to the city dimension, you want to add the age tier dimension to group your users by age.
03:48
After the query is run, the table doesn’t show the intended results.
03:52
For example Los Angeles appears on multiple rows, and only four of the top 10 cities are displayed.
03:58
This is where a pivot can be useful.
04:00
Pivoting the table by the Age Tier dimension brings the age tier to the top of the table, and now all age tiers and cities are visible.
04:09
When you pivot on a dimension, each unique possible value of that dimension becomes its own column header.
04:16
Any measures are then repeated under each column header.
04:20
After you pivot the results, you can easily compare results by different groupings and identify potential gaps, all while leaving your underlying data unaffected.
04:29
Let’s go back to the Looker user interface and use another example to demonstrate how pivots work.
04:36
In the Order Items Explore, the Total Sale Price measure is added.
04:40
Next, the Product Category and Department dimensions are added to group the results by these characteristics.
04:47
After the query is run, the two departments appear on multiple rows.
04:51
This table can be made more useful and easier to read by adding a pivot.
04:55
Pivoting on the department dimension brings department to the top of the table, so when you rerun the query, each department is displayed in a single column.
05:04
If you notice some interesting insights or trends in your data, you can save your findings to a dashboard or as a Look.
05:11
A Look is a single, saved report or visualization.
05:15
Looks typically answer an individual data question, and they can be added to a dashboard.
05:19
A dashboard is a series of saved reports, all on one page.
05:24
A dashboard presents the answers to multiple data questions, and is often where data explorers store their data findings.
05:31
Explores, Looks, and dashboards can all be shared with others.
05:36
You learn more about data sharing in this course.


#######################################Make Data-driven Decisions by Using Looker

In addition to Looker, you can use Looker Studio to visualize your data.
00:05
Looker provides powerful analytics tools for analyzing data and creating reports.
00:11
Looker Studio features less analytics functionality and focuses more on a simple, easy to use interface for data visualization.
00:18
Looker Studio offers several features that make it easy to share and collaborate on reports.
00:24
You can publish reports to the web, and you can also embed reports in other applications.
00:30
The benefits of using Looker Studio for data visualizations include: A drag-and-drop interface that makes it easy to create reports and dashboards.
00:38
Various reports and dashboards, including charts, graphs, and tables.
00:43
Powerful features that let you create professional-looking reports, such as the ability to add filters and drill down into data.
00:50
Real-time collaboration on reports and dashboards.
00:53
And security features that let you control who has access to your data.
00:57
Looker and Looker Studio can be integrated using the Looker connector for Looker Studio.
01:03
This integration lets you connect to any Google Cloud-hosted Looker instance and create reports and dashboards by using Looker data.
01:10
The Looker connector is just one of many different connectors available in Looker Studio.
01:15
To use the Looker connector, you must first enable the integration in your Looker instance.
01:19
After the integration is enabled, you can create a new report in Looker Studio and select the Looker connector as your data source.
01:26
You’re then prompted to enter the URL of your Looker instance and to select an Explore.
01:32
Once you have selected an Explore, you can start creating your report by using Looker data.
01:38
To create a situation-appropriate visualization in a report in Looker Studio, you need to consider the following: First, what type of data are you working with?
01:47
Second, what insights are you trying to communicate?
01:50
What you’re trying to communicate will influence the type of visualization option you choose.
01:55
And finally, who is the audience you are creating the report for?
01:58
The audience may influence how you style and organize your report.
02:02
Next, let’s examine the most common visualization options in Looker Studio.
02:07
Bar charts are a great way to compare data across different categories.
02:12
Line charts are a great way to show how data changes over time.
02:16
Area charts are similar to line charts, but the area below the line is filled in.
02:20
Pie charts are useful to show the relative proportions of different categories.
02:25
Donut charts are similar to pie charts, but they leave a hole in the center.
02:29
Scatterplots are a great way to show the relationship between two variables.
02:34
Heatmaps are used to show the distribution of data.
02:37
And lastly, maps show data that is geographically located.
02:41
In addition, you can also create custom visualizations with Looker Studio.
02:45
Let’s demonstrate how to create a simple chart in Looker Studio by using Looker data.
02:50
In this example, Looker has already been connected as the data source by using the Looker connector.
02:56
A report in Looker Studio is the same as a dashboard in Looker, and consists of one or several charts.
03:02
Charts are ways to visualize dimensions and metrics.
03:05
You can create a chart in Looker Studio by clicking Add a chart in the toolbar, and then selecting the type of chart you want to use.
03:12
Let’s assume you work at an Ecommerce store, and you want to visualize the count of orders for each category over the past year.
03:19
A line chart or an area chart would be a great visualization for this type of data.
03:24
After you select your desired chart, it’s added to the report.
03:28
Next, customize the data, much like you would in Looker, by adding dimensions for the order created date and product category.
03:38
Created date is a date range, so it’s added as the date range dimension.
03:43
And the data will be broken down by the product category, so specify Products category as the breakdown dimension.
03:53
The chart currently displays all order data from the past few years.
03:57
To limit the results–in this case, to the past year–add a filter.
04:20
And now the chart displays the count of orders by date, broken down by category, over the past year.
04:29
Finally, under the style tab, you can customize the different components of the chart, such as labels, colors, and fonts, or you can switch to a different visualization altogether.


####################################Make Data-driven Decisions by Using Looker

00:00
The value of Looker and Looker Studio does not end with data analysis and visualization.
00:06
Sharing reports and dashboards with others improves collaboration, enables data-driven decision-making, and increases transparency.
00:14
Data can be shared from both Looker and Looker Studio.
00:18
In this lesson, you learn the benefits and drawbacks of each.
00:21
First, let’s explore data sharing from Looker.
00:25
Sharing data in Looker improves communication and collaboration, which leads to faster decision-making and improved efficiency.
00:32
In addition, Looker provides a centralized repository for data, which ensures that data is accurate, consistent, and easy to find.
00:39
Looker is also scalable, and can be integrated with other data sources and applications.
00:44
However, there are also some drawbacks to using Looker to share data.
00:48
First, Looker stores data in the cloud, which means that it’s potentially vulnerable to security breaches.
00:54
However, Looker does offer several security features that can help to protect data, such as encryption and access control.
01:01
Second, Looker is a paid platform, and the cost can be a factor for some organizations.
01:06
Finally, Looker is a relatively complex platform, and there can sometimes be a steep learning curve.
01:12
Alternatively, you can use Looker Studio to share data.
01:16
Benefits of using Looker Studio include: Ease of use: Looker Studio is a user-friendly platform that makes it easy to share data.
01:24
Users can create and share dashboards and reports with others, and they can also embed them in websites and applications.
01:31
Flexibility: Looker Studio offers various features that let you customize the data sharing experiences.
01:38
For example, you can control who has access to data, and you can also set permissions for different types of data.
01:44
And lastly, security: Looker Studio offers security features that help to protect data, such as encryption and access control.
01:52
However, Looker Studio is overall a less powerful platform than Looker, and does not offer the full set of features that Looker has.
01:59
For example, Looker Studio does not support advanced data modeling or machine learning.
02:04
Looker Studio also does not integrate with as many data sources as Looker.
02:08
The lack of integrations can make it difficult to share data from various sources.
02:12
Ultimately, the best platform for data sharing depends on the specific needs of the organization.
02:18
Looker is a good choice for organizations that need a powerful and scalable platform for data sharing.
02:24
Looker Studio is a good choice for organizations that are in search of a user-friendly platform.
02:30
Now that you understand the benefits and drawbacks of data sharing with Looker and Looker Studio, let’s examine how to share data in Looker.
02:38
This is often referred to as a “data delivery.”
02:41
This Explore displays the results of a query.
02:44
From the Settings menu, you can share your data-driven insights in a few different ways.
02:47
First, you can save it as a report, called a Look, or to a dashboard, displaying several reports.
02:54
Alternatively, to export data on a one-time basis, you can download or send it.
03:00
Downloading extracts the data to your own computer.
03:03
Looker supports downloading in different file formats, including a CSV, a zip file of one or more CSVs, a PDF, or a PNG.
03:12
Sending lets you deliver the data somewhere else.
03:15
The most popular destination is email; for example, you could email the dashboard to yourself and your manager.
03:22
To send the data more than once, create a schedule, and define how often the report is sent to others.
03:28
Scheduling is basically the same as sending, except with a delivery frequency such as daily or weekly.
03:34
This is useful if you want to have a spreadsheet of the Look’s data automatically delivered to your inbox, say every Friday afternoon at the end of your work week.
03:42
Finally, to send others the most recent data, you can simply click Share, then copy the URL, and send it to the people who need to see it.
03:51
With the right permissions, those individuals can view the data.
03:54
Next, let’s transition to data sharing in Looker Studio.
03:58
Looker Studio is built on top of Google Drive, so you can share your reports and data source the same way you share docs, spreadsheets, and slides.
04:06
Just like with Google Drive, users are given edit or view permission on the shared data.
04:12
You can share a report in Looker studio from the Looker Studio home page or from the report itself.
04:19
From the report, in addition to sharing, you can schedule a delivery, get a link to the report, or download it.
04:25
Sharing in Looker Studio is very similar to Google Drive.
04:28
You can choose whether you want recipients to be able to view or edit the report.
04:34
Simply click Send to share the report.
04:37
Data can be visualized and shared from both Looker and Looker Studio.
04:41
What’s right for you and your team depends on the specific needs of your organization.


###########################The Looker platform

Welcome to “What is Looker?”, a lesson in the “The Looker platform” module.
00:05
Let us discuss what the Looker platform is and how it empowers people who collect and leverage data.
00:13
Let us start at the beginning.
00:14
Specifically, Looker is a powerful tool that helps you… Access and review the data your company collects.
00:22
Get your questions answered as you have them.
00:25
Stay up to date with the status of your business.
00:28
And use data in your daily decisions instead of waiting to get a new report.
00:34
To consider how Looker can support your data workflows, let’s examine the overall data analysis process and the role of Looker in this process.
00:44
When working with data, it’s important to have clear objectives.
00:49
We suggest a data analysis process that includes the following components: First, define questions.
00:57
Identify what questions need to be answered using your data.
01:01
Next, identify required data.
01:03
Determine the specific dimensions and measures you will need to answer those questions.
01:09
Third, analyze data.
01:12
Explore the dimension and/or measure relationships via tables and visualizations.
01:18
This exploration of your data should empower you to take some kind of action or make some kind of decision with regard to your work.
01:26
Finally, interpret the results.
01:28
Glean actionable insights from your analyzed data.
01:32
Looker can support you throughout this process.
01:35
For example, you can explore your data in Looker to help you define questions and identify necessary datasets.
01:43
Then, you can use Looker to analyze and visualize data to answer your questions.
01:48
Last, you can share visualizations and dashboards with your stakeholders to facilitate discussion on the results and identify next steps.
01:58
Independent of the datasets used, this data analysis process is transferable and can provide a useful framework for thinking about how Looker can be integrated into your existing workflows.

##################################################LOOKER
Looker is an enterprise platform for data experiences.
00:04
Let’s review how to navigate the Looker platform and how you can use it to explore your organization’s data.
00:13
Looker is a browser-based cloud application, which means you access it by opening an internet browser like Chrome or Firefox, going to a URL, and logging in.
00:24
For example, the URL for a company’s Looker instance might be companyname.looker.com.
00:30
Typically, you can log in to an instance with an email and password combination, though your company might have single sign-on enabled.
00:40
In that case, you would click on an “Authenticate” button to get in, without the need to remember or store separate credentials.
00:49
When you first log in to the Looker platform, your home page may vary depending on what your company’s Looker administrator has configured.
00:59
In this example instance, we are seeing the Shared folders.
01:03
Folders in Looker are where content lives, just as files in your computer or Google Drive are stored in folders.
01:11
“Content” in Looker terminology refers to Looks and dashboards.
01:16
Looks are standalone reports or visualizations, while dashboards contain more than one visualization.
01:22
We’ll dive deeper into all this as we explore this example Looker instance.
01:28
Let’s review the navigation options available to different types of users in Looker.
01:35
First, the left-side panel provides the content navigation options for users that have been added to the
01:40
Looker instance as data viewers, which are users who need to find existing information quickly and easily.
01:48
Data viewers do not create their own reports and visualizations.
01:53
Now, if you have been added as a data explorer to a Looker instance, you
01:57
will also see the Explore section of the left-side navigation panel of the Looker user interface.
02:06
As a data explorer, you use Explores to ask questions of your data and create visualizations and reports that can be shared with others such as data viewers.
02:17
For example, if you wanted to learn specifics about citibike trips in your city, you’d choose the Citibike Trips Explore.
02:26
Explores are curated by Looker developers in a proprietary templating language called LookML.
02:33
The Explores that you have been given access to will be listed under this Explore section.
02:38
The Explore section of Looker is where we’ll be spending the majority of our time in this walkthrough.
02:44
Next, the Develop menu is used by LookML developers to curate the Explores that are accessible to data explorers via the Explore section.
02:55
Within the Develop environment, developers can specify which fields are available in each Explore, how each field appears, and the logic or behavior for each field.
03:07
Developers can use the toggle button at the bottom left-side of the user interface to enter
03:12
Development Mode to make and test changes to LookML code before sending the changes to production.
03:20
At your organization, you may not see a Develop menu if that is not part of your role.
03:26
We will not review the options in the Develop environment in this walkthrough, as we will work with Explores that have already been created by LookML developers.
03:37
Finally, Looker administrators use the Admin menu to configure the users, permissions, and other settings for the Looker instance such as database connections.
03:47
Again, in your organization’s Looker instance, you may not see an Admin menu if that is not part of your role.
03:55
We will not be using the options in the Admin menu in this walkthrough either.
04:00
In this walkthrough, we will focus on resources available through the Shared folders and Explore
04:06
menus, which provide the key options for data explorers to access, analyze, visualize, and share data.
04:15
From the left-side navigation panel of the Looker user interface, you can access your recent Looker content browsing history in Recently Viewed.
04:24
This might be useful if you need to access a report from a day or
04:27
two ago, but can’t remember what it’s called or aren’t sure where to look for it.
04:33
When you do find something that you want to save for future reference, you can add it as a favorite—and then access your list of Favorites from here.
04:42
This section will contain all of your favorited dashboards and Looks.
04:48
A useful feature that you can toggle is the menu icon in the top left corner of the page to collapse or expand the left-side navigation panel anytime.
04:59
Moving on, Boards serve as a useful way of organizing and curating content, such as saving multiple Looks and dashboards onto one board that you can share with others.
05:10
Finally, if your Looker administrator has installed any applications or Blocks (which are pre-built data models from the Looker Marketplace), they would also show up in the left-side navigation panel.
05:24
Applications are not in the scope of this walkthrough.
05:27
Each user has a personal folder with their name on it; in the current view, it is labeled as My folder.
05:34
For you as a Looker user, this is your own scratch space for works in progress,
05:38
as well as a storage space for content that is only meaningful to you or your role.
05:45
Finally, expanding the Folders menu allows you to see additional folders beyond the Shared folders.
05:52
For example, you can go to the People folder under All folders to see other users’ personal folders.
05:59
Now, in the top right corner, you’ll see five (5) icons: The book being read leads to specific Looker education and in-application tutorials.
06:10
The magnifying glass allows you to search across the Looker instance by keyword and also links you back to Looker Connect for learning assistance.
06:19
The Looker Marketplace is where you can find applications and tools to get more out of your data.
06:26
The help icon provides links to chat support, docs, a user guide, and more.
06:32
And the user icon is where you’ll find access to information associated with your Looker account.
06:38
Let’s shift our focus to the Shared folders page, and explore folders and content.
06:46
Folders contain Looks and dashboards for specific groups of people.
06:50
You can copy, move, or save Looks and dashboards to a folder.
06:55
Folders can also contain sub-folders.
06:59
The Dashboards section shows various pieces of data in one location, like the Business Pulse dashboard, for example.
07:06
Each section of a dashboard is referred to as a single visualization or tile.
07:12
Okay, let’s examine a dashboard.
07:16
In our ecommerce company, we want to see how business is going at our company, so we can click
07:21
on the example “Business Pulse ‘21” dashboard. Dashboards in business intelligence show you various pieces of information about some overall
07:31
topic or domain, similar to how a dashboard on a car shows you various aspects of your car’s performance: how
07:37
quickly you are going, how much gas you have left in the tank, whether your headlights are on, and so
07:44
on. So in dashboards like “Business Pulse ‘21” you can see some key metrics that a typical ecommerce company
07:52
would care about: the number of users, average amount they spend per order, average amount each spends in their lifetime,
07:59
number of orders so far this year, and how that compares to the same point in time last year. We
08:07
call these single-value visualizations. Scrolling down the dashboard, you can see some other visualization types Looker supports out of the
08:17
box including area and line charts, maps, tables, donut multiples, and column charts. Now let’s say you work in
08:26
Marketing, and you want to see some more information about the average spender per user in 2018, maybe because you
08:33
want to understand more about why they’re spending as much as they are, and also seek opportunities to connect them
08:41
with more products they might want to purchase. In Looker, you can click on any visualization to “drill down,” meaning
08:47
you can see a more detailed breakdown of the data. Clicking on the number for Average Spender Per User shows
08:57
you details. In this case, we’re starting at a high-level with just the Order IDs for those purchases. But, what
09:04
if you want to know more about these customers, like their ages and locations? If you have permission to access
09:11
the underlying data, you will usually find an option to Explore or Explore from Here to drill down into additional
09:21
information. Clicking on this option takes you out of the dashboard and into a separate interface called the Explore.
09:29
Yes, this is a different part of Looker. From this point on, you can work with the underlying data through
09:35
the Explore without affecting the "Business Pulse ‘21" dashboard that you were just viewing. We’ve mentioned Explores a few times,
09:43
so you may be wondering what exactly is an Explore? Well, an Explore is a report-builder interface, as well as
09:50
a portal to ask questions of your data. To the left of the screen is the field picker. Fields
10:00
are bundled in these expand-collapse menus called views. Each view is a related concept. Since you are in the Order
10:08
Items Explore, you have a view for order information, such as when an order was created, its ID, its status,
10:15
and so on. However, orders do not exist in a vacuum. They are ordered by people, or users. The goods
10:23
come from inventories. The goods have product information such as brand and category. And they come from distribution centers.
10:33
As you explore order data or assemble a report about orders, you may need to include fields from some or
10:39
all of these other views. That is why they are all offered together in this Order Items Explore. Let’s expand
10:47
the Users view. Each view has dimensions at the top, which are attributes of the data, and measures at the
10:55
bottom, which are aggregations of the data attributes. For now, let’s continue our narrative as a marketer looking for those
11:03
additional opportunities to connect customers with products they will love.. Maybe you’d like to view average spend by user by
11:11
product brand; you could filter on Brand and make it one of your company’s leading brands, Brand A. After adding,
11:19
removing, or modifying fields in the Explore, you always need to click the Run button in the top right corner.
11:27
Just like that, you have asked a question of the data—What is the average spend by user for Brand A?
11:33
—and received your results.
11:36
But how do you share this view of your data with others?
11:40
If you click on the gear menu next to the Run button in the higher
11:43
right-hand corner of the application, you can save and share this new data-driven insight a few
11:50
different ways: From the Save expander menu, you can choose to save it to either
11:54
a new or existing dashboard (to which you have previous access), or to a new Look.
12:01
You could also open this data in Looker Studio, for more advanced visualization design.
12:07
If you just want to share this data as is, you can choose to Send it one time.
12:12
However, if you wanted to send data more than once, you can create a schedule for that and define how often that occurs.
12:20
Or… you could even just share the URL for the Explore as you see it now for others to work with.
12:28
Back on the Shared folders page, you can also see a list of available Looks.
12:33
Unlike a dashboard, a Look is a single report.
12:38
For example, a Look called Yearly Revenue is a standalone report of yearly revenue for 2018 to 2021 displayed in a single visualization.
12:48
Now, after this brief overview of the Looker user interface, we hope that you are excited to explore Looker some more to analyze and visualize your data!


##########################################LOOKER PLATFORM

Now, a common challenge that organizations face is that people struggle to find relevant content that already exists, so they make their own, causing duplicates and confusion.
00:12
To help you address this challenge, Looker provides many ways to organize content to make it more
00:17
discoverable to others at your organization, including the ability to create and share folders within your Looker instance.
00:26
To see the organizational structure of folders in your Looker instance, you can expand the Folders menu on the left-side navigation panel of the Looker user interface.
00:37
Under Folders, you will typically see Shared folders (which contains all folders shared across an organization), My folder (which
00:44
is your personal folder), and All folders (which shows all folders that you have access to in your Looker instance).
00:53
Now, depending on the settings configured by your Looker administrator, it is common for the Shared folders page to
01:00
be set as the home page for users (as shown in this example), but it doesn’t have to be.
01:07
All shared folders that are accessible to you will appear at the top of the Shared folders page under the header called Folders.
01:15
Of course, if you have been granted the permission to create new folders in your Looker instance, you can create
01:21
a new shared folder by clicking on New button in the top right-hand corner next to the gear menu icon.
01:29
A new window will open for you to name the new folder.
01:34
The new shared folder will be visible to all users within your Looker instance that can access items within Shared folders.
01:41
A best practice when creating a new shared folder is try to ensure the overall folder structure remains clear and intuitive.
01:51
In this example, there is a folder for each business team or unit, so if you
01:54
need to know more about Professional Services’ current projects, it is clear where you need to go.
02:02
Of course, the appropriate folder names and structure will differ by organization, but the objective of promoting discoverability and ease of use is key for all organizations.
02:14
Remember, the goal of the shared folder is to make the content stored there as easy to find and use as possible.
02:22
Be sure to take a moment to review the existing Shared folders structure as you decide when and where to create new folders and their appropriate names.
02:32
The next folder type under Folders is labeled My folder.
02:37
In Looker, all users are provided with their own personal folder as a scratch location to work with content.
02:45
Within your My folder, you will see items that you have created and stored in
02:48
your personal folder, including Looks and dashboards, as well as subfolders that you may have created.
02:56
While your personal folder is intended to be your own space for works in progress, and other items that you may not
03:02
need to share, other users within a Looker instance can be granted access to your personal folder, if needed, by Looker administrators.
03:13
Just like in the shared folders, you can click on New within My folder to create a new folder, if you have the permission to do so.
03:21
Again, a new window will open for you to name the new folder.
03:26
Last, the option for the drop-down People folder list is useful to easily and quickly see all of the folders that you have access to within your Looker instance.
03:37
So, in summary, with these various folder options, Looker makes it easy for you to
03:42
manage your content, so that it is readily discoverable and usable by others at your organization.
03:50
Have fun exploring the folders in your Looker instance!


############################Data analysis building blocks
Dimensions are attributes or characteristics of your data.
00:04
Specifically, each column in a database table is a dimension in Looker.
00:11
For example, this is a basic 12-row dataset that describes the fruit basket in the image on the left.
00:18
Each piece of fruit is represented as a row in the table, with each column describing a different attribute or aspect of the fruit.
00:27
Each fruit has a type and a color, either is or is not round, and has a price per pound, weight, and unit price.
00:35
In Looker, all of these columns are dimensions.
00:39
Using this dataset, you can ask a question like, “What types of fruit are in the basket?”
00:46
What is the dimension you need here?
00:48
Fruit Type!
00:49
When you select a dimension in Looker, only the unique possible values are displayed.
00:55
As such, the Fruit Type dimension returns 5 rows for the 12 fruits: one each for oranges, apples, bananas, lemons, and limes.
01:05
Even though you can see in the basket there are 3 lemons, 2 bananas, and
01:09
so on, you don’t get multiple rows for them; you have only one row for each.
01:16
Now, you may also want to know, “What colors of fruit are in the basket?”
01:22
This would require the Color dimension in Looker.
01:25
Again, only the unique possible values are returned.
01:30
Instead of getting 12 rows of data, you only get 4—one for each for yellow, red, orange, and green.
01:37
Okay, but what if you want to know the combinations of fruit types and colors in the fruit basket?
01:45
Now this would require choosing two dimensions in Looker.
01:49
Notice that you now have 6 rows.
01:52
Selecting two or more dimensions returns all unique combinations of the values.
01:57
For example, the “apple” type is displayed twice, once for the red apples and again for the green.
02:04
Be aware that selecting multiple dimensions may result in more rows or different groupings than you may have initially expected.
02:13
In analytical queries, the dimensions are grouped by the different unique ways in which they can be combined, such as both fruit type and color.
02:22
A different example might be a reporting of metrics by different cities.
02:27
In this case, selecting only the city dimension may not give you what you want, as
02:31
all cities with the same name would group together, regardless of their state, province, or territory.
02:38
To separate the cities with the same name, you would need to add the state, province, or territory, and you will then get the individual cities broken out as expected.
02:50
In summary, dimensions help you to identify and select data attributes that you need to answer your questions in Looker.
02:58
Each column in a database table is a dimension in Looker, and you can combine dimensions to return all of the unique combinations of the values.

#########################Data analysis building blocks
So, what are measures, anyway?
00:03
Measures are calculations performed across multiple rows of data.
00:07
As such, measures are aggregates of data attributes, or dimensions.
00:13
In summary, dimensions help you to identify and select data attributes that you need to answer your questions in Looker.
00:21
Each column in a database table is a dimension in Looker, and you can combine dimensions to return all of the unique combinations of the values.
00:31
Now, one question you might have is “How many pieces of fruit are in the basket?”
00:37
Any time you have a question like “how many,” you probably want to look for a measure with the word Count or Number in it.
00:46
In this case, you need the Count measure, which tells you that the basket has 12 pieces of fruit.
00:53
Another question might be “How much does the basket of fruit weigh?”
00:57
Well, in this case, you want to know the sum or total of all these fruits’ weights, without the basket.
01:05
An existing measure in the dataset might be called something like Total Weight, which aggregates the weights of all of individual fruit in the dataset.
01:15
In summary, as highlighted in these examples, measures are useful for aggregating dimensions (or data attributes),
01:20
so that you can easily calculate values such as count, sum, or even averages across your data.

###################################################Data analysis building blocks
In Looker, filters are ways to reduce or narrow down the results returned based on specific criteria.
00:08
In this way, filters allow you to hone in on a subset of your data based on desired characteristics.
00:14
A key feature of filters is that they don’t delete anything from the database; they’re only applied to the data that Looker displays on your screen.
00:24
For example, in this basic 12-row dataset, each piece of fruit is represented as a row in
00:30
the table, with each column describing a different attribute of the fruit, such as type and color.
00:37
How might you want to filter this fruit basket?
00:40
Well, maybe you want to see only fruits that are round.
00:44
You can apply a filter on the Is Round dimension, and set it equal to “yes”.
00:49
This is called applying a dimension filter, and what Looker does behind the scenes is to
00:54
figure out which rows of data need to be included or excluded right from the start.
01:01
Now, using this filter, you can ask a question such as, “How many pieces of each fruit type are there if only round fruits are included?”
01:12
Behind the scenes, your database first skips over or ignores the fruits that aren’t round, since they don’t meet the criterion of our dimension filter.
01:21
Then, Looker takes what’s left—apples and oranges—and performs the aggregation, so we get 3 apples and 2 oranges.
01:30
Of course, you may also want to know, “How many pieces of each fruit type are in the basket if I only include red and orange fruits?”
01:39
To answer this question, you can apply a filter on the Color dimension and set it equal to “orange” or “red”.
01:47
So you get 2 oranges and 2 red apples.
01:51
This demonstrates that you can make a filter equal to more than one value.
01:57
In summary, you can use dimension filters to select only the data you want to see in your results, such as round fruit only, without affecting the underlying data tables.
02:08
You can also select more than value for a particular dimension filter, such as fruit that are either orange or red.
02:16
Based on the values you provide in the dimension filter, Looker knows which data rows
02:20
to include or exclude in the results, making it easy to get the results you want.

#####################################################################Data analysis building blocks
In Looker, you can filter on both dimensions and measures to select only the data you want to see or include in your results.
00:09
In either case, the underlying data is not affected, and Looker knows which data to include or exclude based on the filter.
00:18
Specifically, Looker will ignore any rows that do not meet the filters provided before returning the results.
00:25
For example, in this basic 12-row dataset, each piece of fruit is represented as a row in
00:31
the table, with each column describing a different attribute of the fruit, such as type and color.
00:38
Notice that there are three apples in this dataset: 2 red and 1 green.
00:44
If a dimension such as color is used a filter, then Looker will apply that filter first and then aggregate data based on the measure that has been selected.
00:55
In this example filter, only fruit that are orange or red are selected, which means that the green apple in the dataset is not returned in the results.
01:05
For this reason, the number of apples has decreased from 3 to 2.
01:09
Again, this is because the dimension filter removed one apple that was green.
01:14
But, what if you want to know, “Which types of fruit have exactly two pieces in the basket?”
01:21
In this case, you would need to apply a filter on the Count measure, setting it to equal 2.
01:27
Notice that in this dataset, only the banana, lime, and orange fruit types have a count of two.
01:34
Both apple and lemon have a count of three, so they should not be returned as part of the results.
01:42
With this example, you can see that the key difference between filtering dimensions versus measures lies in when Looker decides to exclude data.
01:51
With dimension filters, Looker excludes the rows that do not meet the filter at the very beginning, such as excluding fruit that are not red or orange.
02:01
With measure filters, Looker first gets all the possible rows and calculates all of the potential aggregations.
02:08
Then, Looker discards the undesired results at the end, before returning the results.
02:15
In this specific example, Looker did not return the fruit types that are apple or lemon
02:19
because they both have a count of three, not two as specified in the measure filter.
02:25
Let’s consider another example.
02:28
Maybe you want to know “Which types of fruit have an average price that is less than $0.50?”
02:35
First, you need to set a filter on Average Price being less than 0.5.
02:42
Looker gets all the unique possible fruit types and calculates the average price for each.
02:48
Then, it removes the results with an average price of fifty cents or more as
02:53
the last step, so you are left with only the results that meet the filter logic.
03:00
In summary, you can filter on either dimensions or measures in Looker to select only the data that you want to see or include in the results.
03:10
When you use a dimension filter, Looker will exclude the rows that do not meet the criteria at the very beginning of the analysis.
03:18
When you use a measure filter, Looker first calculates all of the potential aggregations and then excludes the
03:24
results that do not meet the desired criteria at the end of the analysis, before returning the results.
03:33
In either case, Looker handles the inclusion and exclusion of data for you and returns only the data results that you want.

##########################################Data analysis building blocks

In this example, we combine dimensions and measures to start answering more complex questions.
00:06
Specifically, we’ll work with the Users data in the Order Items Explore to identify the top 10 cities that have the most users.
00:15
Then, we’ll display the results as a column chart.
00:19
To begin, to access the Users data, we will click on the Explore section in the left-side navigation panel, and locate Order Items under the E-Commerce heading.
00:31
“Total number” suggests that you probably want a count, so first expand the Order Items view to look for a count measure of ordered items.
00:42
Click on the Order Item Count measure.
00:44
“Each month” means you want a monthly report, so you need to choose one of the date dimension groups.
00:51
Since you’re looking for items “sold,” Created Date would be best, as an order is “created” in
00:56
the system when the transaction is made—in other words, when the items are sold to a customer.
01:03
Now, expand Created Date and click on the Month dimension in the Created Date group to get your monthly report.
01:12
Recall that you only want to look at the year 2019, so you can click on the Filter button next to Year to specify this.
01:20
Set the operator to “is in the year”, and type 2019 in the text box.
01:26
Then, click Run.
01:28
Now, open the visualization pane, and make sure the type is set to line chart.
01:34
Next, change the style of the data points within the line chart.
01:39
In the Series tab of the visualization settings, you can choose a Point Style of “None”, “Filled”, or “Outline”.
01:47
This examples uses Filled.
01:49
Finally, you can add in a reference line that shows the average profit across the year.
01:55
In the “Y” tab of the visualization settings, scroll down to the bottom, and click on the Add Reference Line button.
02:03
Then, set the type to Line and the value to Average (Mean).
02:09
The final line chart is now ready and displays the total number of items sold each month in 2019 with the yearly average as a reference line.

###########################################Working with Looker content
Throughout your data analysis and visualization workflows in Looker, you will likely work with Looks that you have already made or that were made by others.
00:10
One of the most common and powerful ways to modify an existing Look is to
00:14
apply filters to it, so that users can limit the results returned based on specified criteria.
00:22
To apply filters to a Look, you need to first enter Edit mode in the Look by clicking on the Edit button in the top right of the screen.
00:31
Now that you are in edit mode, you can add filters in the same way that you apply filters
00:36
in an Explore, by using the field picker in the left-side panel to choose filters from dimensions and measures.
00:43
To apply a filter, click the inverted pyramid icon for the desired dimension or measure to activate the filter.
00:51
This example adds a filter to the total revenue data using the Brand dimension from the Products view.
00:58
This filter will allow users to see only the revenue by month for this one specific brand.
01:04
Next, you must decide whether to pre-populate the filter field.
01:10
Keeping it empty is a perfectly valid choice, as it allows users of the Look to choose if and how to apply the filter.
01:18
This example pre-populates the filter with one filter variable based on a single brand called Example Brand 1.
01:26
After you have chosen the filter logic and variables, click on the Run button next to
01:32
the gear menu icon in the top right corner of the screen to refresh the data.
01:37
By refreshing the data presented in the Look, you can ensure the filter worked as you intended, or modify the filter as needed.
01:46
At this point, you can add additional filters or adjust any other component of the Look.
01:52
We recommend that you make one change at a time and then refresh the Look to validate your results before making your next change.
02:01
This way, you can check that the Look reflects your desired outcomes each time before applying more changes.
02:07
Last, all that is left to do is to save the changes to your Look by
02:11
clicking the Save button in the top right corner of the screen, in the blue bar.
02:17
And here is the new filter saved and integrated thoughtfully into your Look.

###############################Working with Looker content
Working with dashboards to look for insights, trends and to answer data-related questions is very powerful, and Looker makes it easy.
00:10
Unlike a Look, which focuses on a single visualization to answer a single data-related question, dashboards in Looker are designed to contain multiple visualizations, to answer multiple questions.
00:24
It can provide both deep and broad visibility into your data, empowering you to very easily surface problems, insights and opportunities in your business.
00:35
Any end user, including data viewers, can work with existing dashboards to which they’ve been granted access for
00:41
data analysis, but only data explorers can use Explores to create their own dashboards, or dashboards for others.
00:51
But what about working with an already-created dashboard?
00:55
Editing dashboards to add new content or revise the existing layout is also very easy.
01:02
Start by clicking on the three vertical dots icon for Dashboard Actions at the top right of the page, and select Edit Dashboard.
01:11
In edit mode, you’ll see options to add tiles and filters to the dashboard, as well as modify its settings to configure how the dashboard runs and refreshes.
01:22
To add new content to a dashboard, you can click on Add Tile to add a new visualization
01:28
(of which there are many types), a text tile for instructions or additional context, or even a button.
01:37
Selecting a new visualization tile will display the Choose an Explore window for you to build the visualization, which you can then save to the dashboard.
01:47
Selecting a new text tile will open a popup for you to write your desired text.
01:52
Text tiles can be useful as section dividers or commentary for your dashboard viewers.
01:59
You can also choose to write in plain text or in the Markdown language to use more advanced formatting features.
02:07
You can even include a button in your dashboards, allowing you to provide hyperlinks to related internal project content, or external resources.
02:17
Options for styling your new button exist as well!
02:20
Once in edit mode, you can also rearrange the tiles by clicking on the top left corner of a tile and dragging it around to the desired location.
02:30
You can also resize a tile by clicking on the bottom right corner and dragging to the desired size.
02:37
Last, when you are done editing your dashboard, don’t forget to click Save to save your changes!

###########################Working with Looker content

In Looker, dashboard filters, sometimes called global dashboard filters, behave similarly to dimension and measure filters in that they allow users to limit the results based on a specified criteria.
00:15
Let us begin with this dashboard, New York Taxi.
00:18
It’s a dashboard containing no filters.
00:21
So, how can we add them?
00:24
Let us start by clicking on the three vertical dots icon for Dashboard Actions at the top right of the page, and select Edit Dashboard.
00:34
Then, click on Filters in the top menu bar, followed by Add Filter.
00:39
Next, you need to select the dimension and/or measure that you want to use as the filter, such as Passenger Count from the Nyc Taxi Explore.
00:50
You can also use the search bar to find the field name you’d like to filter on, such as searching for other filter options.
00:57
After you have chosen a dimension or measure, you will be redirected to the Settings
01:01
tab of the filter, where you need to provide a few more details for the filter.
01:07
Specifically, you need to give your filter a name or title, choose how the user interacts with the filter, determine
01:13
the layout and whether they can select single or multiple values, and if desired, configure a default value for the filter.
01:23
You can also expand the Additional options to require a filter value or select other filters to be updated when this filter changes.
01:33
This last option is useful if you want what we call a “faceted filter.”
01:38
A common example would be if you have one filter for State and one for City, and you want to make
01:43
sure that when someone selects a state the list of available cities updates to offer only the cities in the selected state.
01:52
On the Tiles To Update tab, you can identify the tiles that you want to update with the new filter.
01:58
Looker even starts you off with some suggested tiles.
02:02
In this example, Looker identifies any tiles that use data from the Nyc Taxi view
02:07
in the Nyc Taxi Explore, so the new filter can automatically be applied to those tiles.
02:16
An important thing to keep in mind about dashboards is that you can add tiles from different Explores—in fact, that flexibility is what makes them so powerful and valuable.
02:28
So sometimes, you may find that only some, but not all, of the tiles get automatically identified
02:33
to be populated with your new filter because the other tiles aren’t based on the same Explore.
02:40
Sometimes you might not want filters to apply to all tiles.
02:44
Again, it’s a question of what you’re trying to achieve with the filter; it’s more about design than any scientific rule.
02:52
For example, imagine that you have a tile that shows passengers per ride for the current year.
02:59
If someone else were to change the Passenger Count filter value to greater than 20, then the tile would
03:04
only display 0 results for the entire year, since taxis do not carry that many people at one time.
03:13
Any time you have a tile like this that is supposed to show data for all time, all regions, all something—you
03:18
might want to head back to the Tiles To Update tab and select the Field to Filter option to “Do not filter”.
03:27
Finally, when you are adding filters to your dashboard, be sure to click Save to save your changes!

#####################################Working with Looker content
Boards are a great way to centralize relevant content that lives in different folders within your organization’s Looker instance.
00:08
The great thing about boards is that they simply link to a content item such as a Look or dashboard, which remains in its original location.
00:17
So boards do not store the actual content, and the original content remains unaffected.
00:24
With boards, you also don’t have to worry about permissions or data privacy because users still
00:29
need access to the folder containing the item, in order to access that content from a board.
00:36
For example, the Favorites menu shows all your own bookmarks, but creating a board allows you to share those bookmarks with other users and teams.
00:46
Any Looks and dashboards added to the board will still live in their original folders; the
00:51
board merely links to them and serves as a centralized page to easily find the content.
00:57
In Looker, creating your own boards is very easy.
01:01
First, on the Looker home page, click on the plus sign (+) icon next to Boards in the left-side navigation panel, and select Create a new board.
01:11
Notice that you also see an option to browse all boards, which we will discuss later in this section.
01:17
Next, give your new board a clear, descriptive name.
01:21
For example, if you are creating a board to contain several business analysis related items, then an appropriate name could be Business Analysis.
01:31
Now, once you have created your new board, you can configure it as little or as much as you like.
01:38
You can add Looks and dashboards by clicking on the “Add content (+) .
01:42
A drop down menu will appear giving you the choice of adding Saved content (in
01:48
the form of Looks and dashboards), or a URL link for other content, including pre-configured Explores.
01:56
Looker also provides the ability to group content by adding new sections, and you can write a description for
02:02
the entire board itself, as well as for each individual section, to aid others in using the board efficiently.
02:11
If you choose the Saved content menu option, a new window will appear where you can choose the Looks and dashboards you want to add to your new board.
02:20
How you choose to group your content is entirely up to you: by team, by customer, by project, by product, by data question, and more.
02:30
Once you have created new sections, you can continue adding content to a section by hovering over the section and clicking on the blue plus sign (+) for Add Content.
02:41
Looker also makes it easy to pin a Look or dashboard to a board when you are viewing the content in its original location.
02:49
For example, from a Look, click on the gear menu at the top right of the screen, and choose Add to a board.
02:57
A window will open for you to choose on which board (and section) this new Look should be pinned for easier discovery and sharing.
03:06
You can follow a similar process to pin a dashboard when viewing it in its original location.
03:12
From a dashboard, click on the three vertical dots icon for Dashboard Actions at the top right of the page, and select Add to a board.
03:21
You can select both the board and optionally, the section of a board for a dashboard.
03:27
When you are happy with your choices, select Add.
03:31
Looker also makes it easy to explicitly share access to your board with others.
03:37
Simply click on the share icon at the top right of the page, and select the users that
03:42
you want to access the board as well as their level of access such as view or edit.
03:48
Remember, boards can be for your own benefit, for people you invite, or even for your entire team or organization.
03:56
Don’t worry, though.
03:58
Even if a user is given access to the board, they cannot view a particular content item on a board if they don’t already have access to see it.
04:08
In addition to creating your own boards, you can also browse all boards that you have access to within your organization.
04:16
On the Looker home page, click on the plus sign (+) icon next to Boards in the left-side navigation panel, and select Browse all boards.
04:25
In the browse window, you will be shown every board to which you have access within your organization’s Looker instance.
04:32
Remember, though, while you may have access to a board, you may not have access to all or any of the content curated on that board.
04:41
To get access to the underlying content, you can reach out to your Looker administrator.
04:47
In summary, boards are a great way to centralize and share content that lives in different folders within your organization’s Looker instance.
04:57
Boards link to content such as Looks and dashboards in their original location, so the pinned
05:03
content is not affected by being added to a board or by user actions on a board.
05:09
Any previously assigned access to a content item is also maintained, so you never have to worry about users accessing content that they have not been previously given access to.
05:21
Given these great benefits, we hope that you take full advantage of boards in your organization’s Looker instance!

#####################################Working with Looker content
In this example, we’ll make our own board and then we’ll see how to share it with other users.
00:06
In the Browse menu, click on the plus (+) icon next to Boards.
00:11
Give it a name like Ecommerce Marketing.
00:14
Next, create a section called Overall business by clicking on the pencil icon next to the first New section.
00:22
Now we’re going to add a dashboard to this board section: the Business Pulse dashboard, by
00:27
clicking on the Add content area, selecting Saved content and browsing to the Business Pulse dashboard.
00:34
Let’s explore how you can share the board and manage other people’s access to it.
00:40
You can share the board with specific individuals or groups managed by your organization.
00:46
You can also specify the type of access that you want to provide such as view and edit access.
00:53
Do you think boards would be useful for your role, team, or organization?

############################################Customizing Explores
In Looker, pivots allow you to turn a selected dimension into several columns, which creates a matrix of your data similar to a pivot table in spreadsheet software.
00:12
This is very useful for analyzing metrics by different groupings of your data, such as getting counts for category or label in your dataset.
00:21
For example, from this basic 5-row dataset, you can ask something like, How many pieces of fruit do I have for each color, and is the fruit round or not?
00:32
While this display is adequate to see that you have 5 fruits that are yellow and not round, 2 that are orange and
00:38
round, etc, it’s not easy to compare all the colors against each other, or just the ones that are round against each other.
00:48
Applying a pivot to the Is Round dimension transforms the display of the data into a format that is more meaningful and easy to interpret.
00:58
When you pivot on a dimension, each unique possible value of that dimension becomes its own column header.
01:05
Any measures are then repeated under each column header.
01:09
In this case, you have one column for Is Round being “yes” and another for “no”.
01:15
It becomes much easier to compare just the counts of round fruit across colors, and the counts of not-round fruit.
01:23
It also shows you gaps in your data, where you don’t have any round or not-round fruit for a particular color.
01:31
In summary, pivots allow you to create and display a matrix of your data, similar to a pivot table in spreadsheet software.
01:40
Specifically, pivots turn a selected dimension into several columns and are applied only to the visual display of your results.
01:49
With pivots, Looker allows you to regroup your data, so that you can easily compare results by different groupings and identify potential gaps, all while leaving your underlying data unaffected.

#########################################Customizing Explores
Whenever you have a question involving one dimension “by” another dimension, that’s a clue that a pivot might come in handy.
00:07
Let’s run through a pivot example to find the total revenue from each product category by product department, and then display the results as a stacked bar chart.
00:18
First, from the Explore section, locate Order Items under the E-Commerce heading.
00:24
Next, select the Total Revenue measure from the Order Items view.
00:29
Next, you need the product category.
00:32
Where is that again?
00:33
Don’t forget, any time you feel overwhelmed by all the views and fields, you can use the field picker’s
00:39
search bar to surface keywords: there’s Product Category in the Inventory Items view and Category in the Products view.
00:49
Go with Product Category in the Inventory Items view.
00:53
You may see multiple options while searching in real Explores in your company’s Looker instance as well.
01:00
Depending on how your data is structured, the same field may appear under multiple views.
01:05
We recommend trying both if you’re worried about the accuracy of the results—and, when in doubt, seek help from your company’s LookML developer team.
01:15
A search for “department” also yields fields under both the Inventory Items and Products views, so again, go with the one in the Inventory Items view.
01:25
However, you’ll want to pivot on this item, so you need to click on the Pivot button.
01:31
Click Run to see the results.
01:33
Note that if you simply clicked on the field name to add it to your result set without pivoting
01:38
first, you can still pivot later by clicking on the gear icon for the column header and then clicking Pivot.
01:46
In the the visualization pane, you can click on the bar icon to make it a column chart.
01:52
Overall, this visualization is a good start, but it doesn’t give a clear idea of how the various categories compare for overall revenue across both men’s and women’s departments.
02:05
For example, which category made more revenue from men’s and women’s products combined?
02:10
Thanks to the pivot, you can edit this to be a stacked bar chart by selecting Stacked under the Plot tab of the visualization settings.
02:19
The stacked bar chart allows you to see that there is more overall combined revenue from Jeans than for any other category.
02:27
And with that, the visualization of total revenue from each product category by department is now complete!

###########################################Customizing Explores
Typically, in Looker, data explorers are given access to one or more Explores predefined by LookML developers.
00:08
At your own company, that would likely mean your data and analytics team, data engineers, or data analysts.
00:16
But sometimes you’ll find you need particular logic for which they haven’t provided a dimension or measure, maybe because you have a new kind of question or use case.
00:27
This is when you might need a table calculation.
00:30
Table calculations are used to define what we call “on-the-fly metrics” because they run on your query results, instead of your whole database.
00:39
You’ll need to start by generating results with at least one dimension or measure, and then you can incorporate these fields into spreadsheet software-like formulas to calculate a new metric.
00:52
With table calculations, you can also set up a custom field that isn’t included in the set of dimensions and measures provided by your LookML developers.
01:02
For example, you can use a table calculation to create a new measure for percent
01:06
of flights cancelled from existing measures on number of flights completed and number of flights cancelled.
01:14
Table calculations are really cool and convenient.
01:17
However, because they run after the query has been set up and are written on the fly, they can introduce
01:23
differences across an organization, and they need to be recreated manually if they are not saved to a Look or dashboard.
01:32
There are a few uses cases where you should consider developing a table calculation.
01:38
The first is to prototype a field or query, like if you want to validate whether it’s useful enough to reuse.
01:46
Similarly, if you need to answer a one-off question, then a table calculation is useful.
01:53
If you find yourself needing the same logic repeatedly, you should work with your LookML developer team
01:58
to have that logic added to the data model as dimensions or measures that everybody can use.
02:06
Another scenario that might call for a table calculation is if you need to create something based purely on the results set and not on the overall data.
02:15
A specific example would be if you want to create a specific kind of visualization, like one not available
02:22
in your current Looker version or for which you don’t have the right types of fields in your data model.
02:29
In this case, you can use a table calculation to translate your data or visualization into the form you want.

##################################Customizing Explores
In Looker, table calculations provide you with the ability to define new metrics instantaneously using custom formulas.
00:09
With table calculations, you can prototype new metrics or create one-off visualizations from your query results,
00:15
without having to wait for a LookML developer to modify the options available in a particular Explore.
00:24
There are four basic types of table calculations in Looker: string, mathematical, logical, and date & time.
00:32
String functions operate on query results that are text.
00:36
For example, they can be used to capitalize letters and words, extract parts of a phrase, check to
00:42
see if a word or letter is in a phrase, or replace elements of a word or phrase.
00:48
In this example table, there are dimensions for Aircraft Category and Country, and a Count measure.
00:55
For some people, this table may not be very easy to read or understand.
01:01
To make the table easier to interpret, you can concatenate the values from these three fields
01:06
with some additional text, and create a nice, user-friendly sentence in a new field called Accident report.
01:14
In your final visualization, you could then hide Aircraft Category, Country, and Count, and simply
01:20
display the user-friendly sentence in the Accident report field that you created with a table calculation.
01:28
With mathematical functions in Looker, you can apply any kind of math on numeric values, such as arithmetic, averages, sums—even running totals and standard deviations.
01:40
In this example, the Order Amount Rounded table calculation is rounding the Amount measure to the nearest decimal with 0 places
01:48
(in other words, the nearest integer), while the Average Order Amount table calculation is calculating the mean of all the Amount values.
01:59
With logical functions, you can check one or more conditions and execute different paths of logic, depending on the value.
02:07
For example, if-conditions are very popular for displaying different results depending on whether our particular condition is met.
02:16
In this example, there is a Title dimension referring to box-office films and measures for Total Revenue and Total Budget.
02:25
The Profit Outcome table calculation evaluates whether the Total Revenue amount for each Title is greater than the Total Budget.
02:33
If it is, the displayed value is the word “Profitable”.
02:37
However, if Total Revenue is less than or equal to Total Budget, the displayed value is “Lost Money”.
02:45
Finally, date and time functions operate on datetime results and allow you to extract time periods and calculate date differences and additions.
02:55
You can also get the current date, time, or date and time, and create arbitrary date fields as needed.
03:03
In this example, there is a Created Date dimension showing when each user registered on our site.
03:10
The Months a Customer table calculation calculates the difference in months between a user’s Created Date and today’s date using the diff_months and now functions.
03:21
The Join Month table calculation extracts the month from the Created Date using extract_months and then applies logic to label the month name using an if-condition.
03:33
For example, if the number extracted for month is 8, then the output is “August”; if it is 9, then the output is “September”; and so on.
03:43
These examples demonstrate how easy it is to combine different types of functions in one table calculation.
03:50
In summary, table calculations allow you to create new metrics instantaneously and are incredibly useful for prototyping new metrics or creating one-off visualizations.
04:03
There are four main types of table calculations in Looker: string, mathematical, logical, and date & time.
04:11
String functions operate on text results, while mathematical functions operate on numeric results.
04:19
Data & time functions operate on datetime results, and logical functions can be used to check one or more conditions and execute different paths of logic, depending on the value.
04:31
Last, you can combine different types of functions in one table calculation to customize your results even further and achieve your desired outcomes.

############################Customizing Explores
Writing and visualizing table calculations to instantaneously create new metrics should follow very familiar logical guidelines, and therefore offer only a reasonable challenge to learn.
00:13
In this lesson, we will work in the Order Items Explore to determine what percentage of revenue per US
00:19
state is from completed orders (out of revenue from all orders for that state) in the past 1 year.
00:27
Then, we’ll create a map of the results.
00:31
Since table calculations only operate on the results of your Explore query, you first need to bring
00:36
in one or more dimensions or measures by selecting the fields you need to calculate the desired metric.
00:44
For example, imagine that you want to calculate the percent of flights cancelled over a period of time.
00:51
To begin, we have selected the dimension for Depart Date and the measures for flight Count and Cancelled Count, and clicking Run.
01:01
After you select the dimensions and measures and run the initial results, you can now create a new table calculation from the results.
01:10
Next to Custom Fields, click the Add button, and select Table Calculation.
01:16
A new popover window will appear in which to enter your formula.
01:20
Now, one thing to be aware of here is that because administrators must enable this feature for end users, you might not
01:27
have the Custom Fields view in the Explore of your organization’s Looker instance, even if you do have permission to use table calculations.
01:38
In that case, you would see a Calculations button at the top of the data table.
01:43
Assuming Custom Fields are available to you, in the table calculation popover, you will need to
01:48
select a calculation type, or leave the selected option for Custom expression to write ad hoc expressions.
01:57
Next, give your new table calculation a name such as Percent of Flights Cancelled.
02:03
This name will show up as the column header and in the legend of the visualization.
02:08
If using a custom expression for the table calculation, enter the formula you’d like to apply.
02:14
For example, you can calculate the percentage of cancelled flights by dividing the cancelled flight count by the overall count of flights.
02:23
Note that Looker strives for parity with commonly used spreadsheet software, so if you simply type the letter a, you can see all the various functions that Looker supports.
02:34
You can get the absolute value of a number, add time intervals to a date, concatenate multiple values, write if-conditions, and so on.
02:44
If you want to see the full list of supported functions and some more information about them, you can click
02:49
on the Help + Syntax Reference icon above the top right of the window, which takes you to our documentation.
02:58
An important thing for people very familiar with spreadsheet software to know is that with Looker table calculations, you do not start the formula with an equals sign.
03:09
That might feel a bit weird, but you’ll get used to it.
03:12
Next, specify the format of the results if you’d like: decimals, percent, and so on.
03:18
Finally, click Save to save your table calculation.
03:23
You will now see table calculations appear in your data table in green.
03:28
The values will show up right away since you have already run your query with the dimensions and measures.
03:35
Table calculations also get displayed in the visualization.
03:39
If you don’t want a specific field or table calculation in your visualization, you can click on the gear icon in the column header and select Hide from Visualization.
03:51
More often than not, the table calculation is the thing you actually want to visualize; it might be the foundational dimensions or
03:58
measures that you don’t want, such as the flight count because you want the visualization to show only the percent of cancelled flights.
04:07
An icon of an eye with a line crossing over it will appear to indicate that the column is hidden.
04:14
So, here’s how the final line chart would look if you keep the dimension and table calculation, but hide the two measures used in the table calculation formula.
04:25
In addition to writing custom expressions for table calculations, you can choose from some predefined options such
04:30
as calculating the percent of column total, percent change from a previous row, running totals, and more.
04:39
With options for both predefined and custom expressions, Looker gives you the power to customize your visualizations and reports as needed.
04:49
In summary, table calculations allow you to instantaneously create new metrics and fields, without needing to wait for a LookML developer to create them for you.
05:00
Enjoy using table calculations.
05:03
Just remember that since they run after the query has been set up and are written on the fly, they can
05:08
introduce differences across an organization, and they need to be recreated manually if they are not saved to a Look or dashboard.
05:19
For these reasons, table calculations are most useful for prototyping new metrics, answering one-off questions, or creating visualizations based purely on query results.
05:30
And with this knowledge, we hope you now look forward to playing around with table calculations in Looker!

####################################Customizing Explores
In this example, we will review how to write and visualize table calculations to instantaneously create new metrics.
00:08
We’ll work in the Order Items Explore to determine what percentage of revenue per US state is
00:14
from completed orders (out of revenue from all orders for that state) in the past one (1) year.
00:21
Then, we’ll create a map of the results.
00:25
Begin by opening the Order Items Explore under the E-Commerce heading.
00:31
From the Order Items view, select the Total Revenue and Total Revenue from Completed Orders measures.
00:38
Click on the Filter button next to the Date dimension in the Created Date group.
00:43
Then, set the Created Date filter to “is in the past” “1” “complete years”.
00:50
Next, in the Users view, select the State dimension.
00:54
Then, click on the Filter button next to the Country dimension, and set the filter to “is equal to” USA.
01:02
Click Run.
01:03
Now that you have the initial query results, you can add a table calculation from the Custom Fields section.
01:11
Click Add next to Custom Fields, and then select Table Calculation.
01:16
Use the Custom expression option and the following syntax for the expression: ${order_items.total_revenue_from_completed_orders}/${order_items.total_revenue} Next, change the format to Percent and decimals to 1.
01:47
Name the table calculation % Revenue from Completed Orders, and then save the table calculation.
01:54
Next, hide the Total Revenue measure and the Total Revenue from Completed Orders measure from the visualization by clicking on each measure’s gear menu, and selecting Hide from Visualization.
02:07
Last, change the visualization type to Google Maps.
02:12
You can also change the default color order in the legend by selecting Reverse Color Scale in
02:17
the Values tab of the visualization settings, so that higher values are green and lower values are red.
02:25
You now have a map visualization of percentage of revenue per US state from completed orders in the past 1 complete year!

####################################Customizing Explores
Percent-of-total calculations can be useful for analyzing a portfolio or market share in your data.
00:07
In this example, we’ll work with the Order Items Explore to create a table calculation that shows the percentage
00:13
of orders coming from each traffic source (such as email or search), out of the total number of orders.
00:21
First, from the Explore tab, locate Order Items under the E-Commerce heading.
00:27
Begin your analysis by getting the raw number of orders per traffic source.
00:32
Navigate to the Order Items view, and select the Order Count measure.
00:36
Next, select the Traffic Source dimension in the Users view, so that you can get order counts by traffic source.
00:44
How do we know the total number of orders?
00:47
Did you spot the Totals checkbox, next to Row Limit?
00:51
Select it, and click Run.
00:53
A Total line will appear under the five rows of data, with the number 286,183.
01:02
Sometimes the Total row won’t match the number if you manually add the rows above it.
01:07
Looker is counting unique objects, not the numbers shown in each row.
01:12
For example, consider an order attributed to more than one traffic source.
01:17
It will appear in the Order Count for each relevant source’s row, but it won’t double or triple-count in the Total row.
01:24
In another example, count the number of users in each month making an order.
01:29
It’s possible that the same user could order every month, but they would still only total as one user versus 12 different people in a single year.
01:39
Or, if you wanted to know the average sale price by traffic source, the Total row would show
01:44
the average sale price for all traffic sources, rather than a total of the average sale prices added together.
01:51
Now, next to Custom Fields, click Add, and select Table Calculation.
01:58
For calculation, choose Percent of column, and select Order Items Order Count as the source field.
02:05
For format, choose Percent, and select 1 for Decimals.
02:10
Don’t forget to give your table calculation a clear, descriptive name such as Percent of Total Order, and click Save.
02:19
You want the percent of each traffic source’s order count out of the total order count, so
02:24
you need ${order_items.order_count}, followed by a forward slash to divide by the appropriate total order count field.
02:39
Begin typing “order” and then select the suggestion for Order Count - Total.
02:45
Order Count - Total has a LookML variable that looks very similar to the order count, except it has a colon and the word “total” at the end.
03:01
${order_items.order_count}/${order_items.order_count:total} Don’t forget to give your table calculation a name, such as % of total order, and choose a format.
03:22
You can select Percent and 1 for decimals, and then click Save.
03:26
Next, change the visualization type to bar chart, and hide the Order Count measure by clicking on the column’s gear menu, and selecting Hide from Visualization.
03:38
Using the visualization settings, under Values, turn on the Value Labels to add a label for each bar.
03:45
Looks nice, right?
03:47
Using table calculations, you are able to show the percentage of orders coming from each traffic source, out of the total number of orders.
03:56
Since Looker provides many different visualization options, why don’t we review some others?
04:02
If you’d like to see the data as a pie chart instead, click on that the pie icon from the visualization menu.
04:09
Using the visualization settings, you can customize the labels and colors.
04:15
For example, you can change the individual colors or the color palette under Under Series > Collection.
04:22
You can also add and customize the labels.
04:25
Under Plot, for Value Labels, select Labels.
04:29
In the same menu for Plot, for Label Type, select Label - Value, and for Start Angle, type: 90.
04:37
And now, the pie chart of percentage of orders coming from each traffic source, out of the total number of orders, is complete.
04:46
You can see that with just a few simple option changes, Looker gives you the power to create multiple types of visualizations from one set of query results.
04:55
Enjoy exploring all of the visualization options in Looker!
