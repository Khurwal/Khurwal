Let’s begin by exploring the role of a Professional Data Engineer in migrating Cymbal Retail’s data from its private data centers to Google Cloud.
00:10
Let’s look at the various challenges a Professional Data Engineer will face in accomplishing this task.
00:17
Cymbal Retail’s existing private data centers are going to be decommissioned in the next two years.
00:23
You need to help migrate existing data and data processing systems to Google Cloud.
00:29
Similar migrations have to also be conducted in acquired companies with their own private data centers.
00:36
As a Professional Data Engineer, your role involves ensuring that there is a uniform approach to managing and securing the data.
00:45
Controlling access at a granular level based on employee role is critical to complying with regional laws and industry regulations.
00:54
You need to understand and deploy options to control the security of data via encryption.
01:00
Whether during migration or in the course of regular operations, certain data has to be captured and stored, but never revealed to other parts of the organization, for example, analysts.
01:13
You need to employ tools to redact information, and you need be able to extend these tools as required to meet future requirements.
01:23
You will be required to move data reliably from external sources into Google Cloud.
01:29
Sometimes, the data movement might be done over many days.
01:33
In other cases, data needs to be quickly moved as and when it arrives in other data sources for up to date analytics.
01:42
As data is moved into Google Cloud, it will also need to be assessed for quality and cataloged for easy discoverability by consumers of the data.
01:53
Cymbal Retail’s data is used simultaneously by different divisions to manage their business—finance, marketing, purchasing, sales, compliance, legal, store operations, and more.
02:04
However, all of these groups do not need access to all the data.
02:11
You should ensure fine-grained control on the data which is strictly on a need-to-know basis.
################################Designing Data Processing Systems

The diagnostic questions in this course can be challenging, and some of them have several layers or decisions to make.
00:07
Let’s examine some approaches you can use when analyzing complicated questions through a detailed discussion of a few diagnostic questions from this first module.
00:17
Let’s start with question
00:19
3. First, consider the question stem.
00:24
We can break the stem up into multiple parts.
00:28
The first part of the stem is the scenario, which gives you context for the question: “You are migrating on-premises data to a data warehouse on Google Cloud. This
00:40
data will be made available to business analysts. Local regulations require that customer information including credit card numbers, phone numbers, and email IDs be captured, but not used in analysis.”
00:58
In this scenario you learn some key information: Your data includes personally identifiable information (PII), but it cannot be used in analysis.
01:10
Next, you can identify the goal statement, or what it is you need to accomplish: “You need to use a reliable, recommended solution to redact the sensitive data.”
01:24
From this goal, you know to look for options that are reliable (accurate and consistent in performance) and follow Google-recommended practices.
01:34
So, what should you do?
01:38
Start by noticing patterns in the responses.
01:42
Two options, A and D, have you use the Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) API.
01:50
Option B has you manually delete columns, and Option C has you create a regular expression to delete information.
01:59
You can eliminate option B right away - it is not reliable.
02:04
Columns might contain sensitive data, even if it is not indicated by the title.
02:10
For example, there could be a comments column with sensitive private information.
02:16
You can also eliminate option C. Determining the regular expressions that match different data types can be more tedious and less accurate than using Cloud DLP.
02:28
This leaves you with the two options using Cloud DLP, and you need to determine the correct usage.
02:35
Look at the differences between them.
02:37
In option A, you identify and redact data that matches certain infoTypes.
02:44
In option B, you perform date shifting of entries.
02:48
You can eliminate option D, because date shifting the entries does not redact the personal identifiable information (PII) like credit card numbers, phone numbers, and email IDs.
03:01
This leaves you with option A. Cloud Data Loss Prevention helps you discover, classify, and protect your most sensitive data.
03:11
There are predefined infoTypes that you can employ to identify and redact specific data types.
03:18
Now, let’s examine question
03:20
4. First, let’s break the stem up into multiple parts.
03:26
It begins with the scenario: “Your data and applications reside in multiple geographies on Google Cloud. Some regional laws require you to hold your own
03:37
keys outside of the cloud provider environment, whereas other laws are less restrictive and allow storing keys with the same provider who stores the data.”
03:48
There is a key point here - to comply with all the laws of some regions
03:51
your organization operates in, you need to hold your own keys outside of the cloud provider environment.
03:59
Next, you can identify the goal: you need a solution that can centrally manage all your keys.
04:07
So, what should you do?
04:10
In this question, each of the responses has you choose a different option.
04:17
You can eliminate one of the responses right away… … because confidential computing does not affect the storage of data.
04:25
Of the remaining responses, all three use services to help manage your keys.
04:32
You need to determine where the keys will be stored.
04:36
Options B and C store keys on Google Cloud.
04:40
Option D stores keys on an external key management partner.
04:45
You can eliminate the options that store keys on Google Cloud, because they won’t meet the requirement for the data and the keys to be stored in different provider environments.
04:56
That leaves you with option D as the correct answer.
05:00
Because you need a single solution that also has to store keys externally, this would be the appropriate choice.
05:09
Use the approach that helps you as you answer diagnostic questions throughout this course.
05:15
Remember to read the question stem carefully, and identify the key points and requirements.
05:22
Some questions have multiple parts.
05:25
Consider each of the requirements posed by the question.
05:28
Find the similarities and differences in the responses, and eliminate responses that do not meet the requirements.
